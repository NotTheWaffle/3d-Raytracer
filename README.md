fancy pathtracer i wrote over a month or so
still under construction because i want to make glasss
has
  - bvh
  - specular reflection
  - specular reflection chance (for plastic-like materials)
  - diffuse reflection
  - variable color emissions
  - color sample accumlation
  - 30 random meshes i found for free in random spots
    - mostly test models
  - a rasterizer built in so you can move around at a reasonable framerate while setting up the camera
  - \[ and \] to toggle pathtracing
  - k to save it to a png named saved.png
  - automatic file compacting of meshes to remove texture and normal stuff cuz i don't use them
